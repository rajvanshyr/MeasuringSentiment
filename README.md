# Measuring Sentiment
This repository showcases how to use Machine Learning to make accurate predictions about the future prices of the cryptocurrency. The Jupyter Notebook(Sentiment Demo.ipynb) walks through the process of using previous price and sentiment data to predict future Etheruem Prices. This process can be used for any cryptocurrency, however, and files that have sentiment data for other cryptocurrencies are also included in this repository. These sentiment files were created by scraping influential posts on Reddit and Twitter using various NLP technologies to score their sentiment at every minute.
